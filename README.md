## About The Project


## Architecture Built With

Because this is a very modest application, MVC would have been a reasonable choice as well. However, by adopting MVVM, the view controller's duties are reduced to regulating the interaction between the view layer and the model layer, and gluing both levels together.

## Tech stack

Here's a quick rundown of the tech stack that this app employs:

The IOS UIkit programming framework is used in this project. The program utilizes Core data for persistent storage (database), which allows it to define storage schema and store it to a local database.

Currently, there is no way to remove certain users after selecting them form the candidate tab.


## Additional info

The program will require additional time to test and implement various features, such as deleting chosen candidates from the local DB, handling network failures, and reorganizing the code. Implementing and parsing JSON and storing it in Core Data was a lot of fun, and reading through the tutorials on how to create it was a good way to brush up on my skills in that area. 

## Submission to the appstore

Right now, I don't believe this app is ready for submission to the App Store for a variety of reasons, including the fact that it will take a few more days to check with Apple platform guidelines, and that some testing from others would be beneficial before submission to the App Store, including whether copyrighted materials are used, and so on.
